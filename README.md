This is a fork of [This repository](https://github.com/PixelsCommander/Download-File-JS).

The new added feature:
   * `Save the downloaded file with your desirable name` â†’ I added a new optional parameter to the downloadFile function (a string of the file's name) and if you insert it, The file will be saved with the desired name (You still can use the function with only one parameter and it will be saved with its original name). It worked well on Firefox 53.0.2 (64-bit) and Google Chrome  56.0.2924.87 (64-bit).
